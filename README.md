# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet

## Project Overview

The Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet project aims to create an interactive map displaying earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The visualization will allow users to explore earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths in an informative and engaging way.

## Project Structure

### Data Retrieval and Visualization:

1. Utilized the Leaflet library to read earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
2. Created a dynamic map displaying earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.
3. Customized data markers to represent earthquake magnitudes (size) and depths (color).
4. Implemented popups with detailed earthquake information upon marker clicks.
5. Designed a legend for interpreting earthquake magnitude and depth.

### Sample Metadata Display:

1. Integrated functionality to display sample metadata, including demographic information.
2. Showcased key-value pairs from the metadata JSON object on the dashboard.

### Interactive Dashboard:

1. Implemented dynamic updates for all plots and information displays upon user interaction.
2. Designed an intuitive layout for seamless exploration of earthquake data.

## Repository Structure

- .gitignore: Excludes unnecessary files from version control.
- README.md: Overview of the project and its structure.
- index.html: Main HTML file for the interactive earthquake visualization.
- static/:
  - css/: Folder containing CSS stylesheets for dashboard styling.
  - js/: Folder containing JavaScript files for interactive functionality.
    - logic.js: JavaScript code for data visualization and user interaction.

## Tools Used

1. Leaflet.js: Utilized for interactive mapping and geospatial data visualization.
2. HTML and CSS: Structured and styled the dashboard interface for optimal user experience.
3. JavaScript: Implemented dynamic content generation and interactivity within the dashboard.
4. GitHub Pages: Deployed the interactive earthquake visualization for public access.

## Conclusion

The Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet project demonstrates my proficiency in creating dynamic and interactive web applications for visualizing geospatial data. By leveraging Leaflet.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages, the project delivers a user-friendly dashboard for exploring and understanding earthquake occurrences worldwide.
